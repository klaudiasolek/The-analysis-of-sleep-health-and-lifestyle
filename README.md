In today's world, health and quality of life are a priority for many people. The project focuses on key aspects of health and their impact on daily life. Special attention is given to the influence of stress, sleep quality, a healthy lifestyle, and physical activity. The aim of this project is to emphasize and demonstrate the significance of these factors. In the analyzed dataset, genders have nearly equal proportions with 50.53% being men and 49.47% women. It was also noted that 41.45% of the analyzed individuals had sleep disorders. Most of the individuals included in the analysis had a normal Body Mass Index (BMI).

**Obesity**

The first area of research was obesity, which has emerged as a global health challenge. Using a map, I visually represented average obesity rates in countries worldwide. Interestingly, the findings revealed that women have a higher obesity rate compared to men. This discovery serves as a significant starting point for further analyses and actions aimed at improving public health.

**Physical activity and sleep**

Another significant area of research has been the relationships between physical activity and sleep quality. The results unequivocally showed that increased physical activity has a beneficial impact on the quality of sleep. This finding can serve as an encouragement for individuals striving to enhance their sleep by increasing their physical activity.

**Stress and sleep disorders**

The studies have also focused on the influence of stress, apnea, and insomnia on the length of sleep. It was found that these factors negatively affect sleep, underscoring the need for stress management and the treatment of sleep disorders to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

**Body Mass Index (BMI)**

By analyzing data on Body Mass Index (BMI), it was discovered that as BMI increases, the number of steps taken daily decreases. This finding suggests that individuals with overweight and obesity should be particularly aware of the need to increase physical activity.

**Stress based on gender and occupation**

In the stress analysis, differences between genders and occupations were also examined. It became evident that there are variations in stress levels, both between men and women and among different professions. It was found that the highest stress levels among men were observed in sales representatives, while among women, scientists had the highest stress levels.
